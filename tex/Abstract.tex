\section*{Abstract}
In this thesis we attempt to understand naive homotopy theory and the naive homotopy classes of k-scheme endomorphisms of the projective line. We will use this to understand Christoph Cazanaves construction of the commutative monoid structure on these homotopy classes, and prove that this monoid is in fact commutative.
