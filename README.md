# Bachelor thesis
This is my bachelor thesis in mathematics from NTNU.
Written and handed in June 2019. There is some bad latex, 
and bad mathematics in there, so readers beware...

There may also be something not loaded correctly--like internal and external references--
as the tex files have been moved around between different programs and compilators.
